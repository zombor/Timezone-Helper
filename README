timezone helper
--------

# What is it

A very simple Kohana helper to easily set and retreive a user's timezone. I use it on rndpass.com to remember the user's timezone for future visits.

# How to use it

Put it in your modules folder, add it to your config, and use display_zones() in your view, and set_tz_by_offset() in your controller to save the timezone.

Note that this helper sets the php timezone to the specified timezone. It's probably done poorly and could use some help. It works though.
